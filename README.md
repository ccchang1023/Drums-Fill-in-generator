# A Drum’s Fill-In Pattern Generator Based On Genetic Algorithm, developed by Chia-Chuan Chang June 2014 </br>
Drum plays an important role in a band, and is one of the mostly used percussion instruments. A complete drum pattern is usually formed by basic pattern and fill-in pattern. I present a genetic algorithm that automatically generates 16th-note drum’s fill-in pattern, providing a basic rhythm input. The program will get the features from basic input pattern, and constructs several fitness rules based on these information.
